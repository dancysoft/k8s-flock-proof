Proof of concept to show use of cross-container flock

To test with just docker:

make image
./test

The above will start 3 containers simultaneously. Each of them will
flock the same temp directory and then sleep for 10 seconds.  The
containers should finish in about 10, 20 and 30 seconds, demonstrating
correct locking behavior.

To test with Kubernetes:

kubectl apply -f job.yaml

After 30 seconds, examine the logs of the test-flock-* pods to verify
the behavior.
